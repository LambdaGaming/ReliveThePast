# ReliveThePast
Note: This was originally a fork of a plugin with the same name created by HonestResolv3, which no longer exists.

Relive The Past is an EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that respawns players as a Scientist or Class D after a set period of time, if they die too early in the round. It's intended to be used on servers with low player counts to increase the length of rounds. There's also an option to have CLass Ds spawn with a keycard after a certain amount of time.

# Notes:
See your EXILED config for respawn options. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
