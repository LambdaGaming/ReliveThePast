# Relive The Past
Relive The Past is an EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that respawns players as a Scientist or Class D after a set period of time if they die early in the round. It's intended to be used on servers with low player counts to prevent rounds from ending early. There's also an option to have Class Ds spawn with a keycard after a certain amount of time.

Respawning is disabled if any of the following conditions are met:
- Light Containment decontamination has started, or is less than 30 seconds away from starting
- Warhead has detonated or countdown is active
- All MTF and Chaos respawn waves have been paused
