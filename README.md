Relive The Past is an EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that respawns players as a Scientist or Class D after a set period of time if they die too early in the round. It's intended to be used on servers with low player counts to prevent rounds from ending early. There's also an option to have Class Ds spawn with a keycard after a certain amount of time.

Players will not be respawned after light containment decontamination has started, or if the warhead countdown is active.
